# Teams
#### Work Style
You are all free to work at your own pace, meaning meet as frequent as you would like. When it comes to coding, depending on how many screens you have, you can pair code. <br>
This means for instance two people can work one screen and code towards the same .js file
<br> <br>
The website must be ***responsive*** on mobile. Another way to work is have someone research into the best way to implement a responsive UI on all screens while the other codes the found solution

### Events Page
Though this page as a single screen, I would recommend crative ways of making the page more interactive and visually pleasing. This does not mean change the UPE background but besides the calendar, what else can be shown on this page?

**The Calendar should be from Google and there are few ways to implement it. Please reach out to Constant, Alondra or Kevyn if you need clarity on this

### Gallery Page
Same outline from Events team applies here, find react ways to implement the gallery page. I good suggestion is to make it a carousel. This will allow users to go through pictues indidually instead of multiple in their face at once. <br> Please reach out to Constant, Alondra or Kevyn if you need clarity on this or want to discuss ideas

2. Click on `Terminal` located on the top left area of the screen. You should see a menu pop up. From the options,
3. Please select `New Terminal`. A new terminal will appear at the botton part of your screen and should look like
this.

This indicates we are in the root folder which should be the name of the repository.

4. Click in the terminal and type `cd my-app`

5. After, type `npm install` to make sure all dependencies are installed

6. Finally, to run in developer mode, type `npm run dev` to load the website locally and see live changes you make.
